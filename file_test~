In my project, I have a bunch of strings that are read in from a file.
Most of them, when printed in the command console, exceed 80 characters in length and
wrap around, looking ugly.

I want to be able to have Python read the string, then test if it is over 75 characters in length. If it is, then split the string up into multiple strings, then print one after the other on a new line. I also want it to be smart, not cutting off full words. i.e. "The quick brown <newline> fox..." instead of "the quick bro<newline>wn fox...".
