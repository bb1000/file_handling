```
>>> file = raw_input("Which inputfile? ") #Answer: allherbs.knx
>>> if "." in file:
       file = file[:file.find(".")]
>>> inp = open(file+".knx",'r')
>>> outas = open(file+".asx",'w')
>>> outob = open(file+".obx",'w')

```

The 'r' points at a file aimed only to be read, while 'w' is aimed only for writing.  

Miraculix can then read line per line...

```
>>> line = inp.readline()
>>> while "Herb" not in line:
>>> 	  line = inp.readline()
>>> for line in file:
>>>       line = inp.readline()
>>>       if (str(line[:5])) is "aster":
>>>             outas.write(line[7:12])
>>>       if (str(line[:5])) is "obeli":
>>>             outob.write(line[7:12])

```
 
Since Miraculix 'opened' the file, it is also important to close it again. Writing only proceeds fysically when the file is closed.

```
>>> inp.close()
>>> outas.close()
>>> outob.close()

```






... and can write line per line...

```
>>> outas.write("Asterix loves herbs\n")
>>> outob.write("Obelix doesn\'t get herbs\n")

```
