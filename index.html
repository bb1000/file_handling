## Example from Back in the Day

Imagine researcher Miraculix has a student Kaningentix, who has called all his
datafiles with a suffix `.knx`.

Miraculix has to split out the herbs for Asterix and Obelix with suffix `.asx`
and `.obx`.

```
$ cat allherbs.knx
Creator of file: Kaningentix
First test
Herbs Celts
aster: herb1
obeli: herb2
aster: herb3
aster: herb4
obeli: herb5
```

To read this file in Python, we need to open it first.

```python
f_inp = open(&#34;allherbs.knx&#34;, &#39;r&#39;)
```

&#39;r&#39; means that the file is opened in read-only mode.

---

## Example from Back in the Day

File are usually read line per line. Sometimes it is useful to know the total
number of the lines in the file.

```python
num_lines = 0
for line in f_inp:
    num_lines += 1
```

---

File are usually read line per line. Sometimes it is useful to know the total
number of the lines in the file.

```python
num_lines = 0
for line in f_inp:
    num_lines += 1
```

Other ways of getting number of lines:

```python
f_inp.seek(0)
lines = list(f_inp)
num_lines = len(lines)
```

```python
f_inp.seek(0)
lines = f_inp.readlines()
num_lines = len(lines)
```

```python
f_inp.close()
```

Note that `inp.seek(0)` is used to make sure that we start over from the
beginning of the file.

---

## Example from Back in the Day

In most cases all the information can be retrieved by reading the file once.

```python
f_inp = open(&#34;allherbs.knx&#34;, &#39;r&#39;)

for line in f_inp:
    if &#34;aster:&#34; in line:
        print(line)
    elif &#34;obeli:&#34; in line:
        print(line)

f_inp.close()
```

&lt;pre&gt;
aster: herb1

obeli: herb2

aster: herb3

aster: herb4

obeli: herb5

&lt;/pre&gt;

## Example from Back in the Day

We can use lists to save the herbs that belong to Asterix or Obelix.

```python
herbs_asx = []
herbs_obx = []

f_inp = open(&#34;allherbs.knx&#34;, &#39;r&#39;)

for line in f_inp:
    if &#34;aster:&#34; in line:
        herb = line.split()[1]
        herbs_asx.append(herb)
    elif &#34;obeli:&#34; in line:
        herb = line.split()[1]
        herbs_obx.append(herb)

f_inp.close()

print(herbs_asx)
print(herbs_obx)
```

print(herbs_asx)
print(herbs_obx)
```

&lt;pre&gt;
[&#39;herb1&#39;, &#39;herb3&#39;, &#39;herb4&#39;]
[&#39;herb2&#39;, &#39;herb5&#39;]
&lt;/pre&gt;

---

## Example from Back in the Day

If we want to save the herbs to file

```python
f_out_asx = open(&#34;allherbs.asx&#34;, &#39;w&#39;)
f_out_obx = open(&#34;allherbs.obx&#34;, &#39;w&#39;)

for herb in herbs_asx:
    f_out_asx.write(herb + &#39;\n&#39;)

for herb in herbs_obx:
    f_out_obx.write(herb + &#39;\n&#39;)

f_out_asx.close()
f_out_obx.close()
```

---

f_out_obx = open(&#34;allherbs.obx&#34;, &#39;w&#39;)

for herb in herbs_asx:
    f_out_asx.write(herb + &#39;\n&#39;)

for herb in herbs_obx:
    f_out_obx.write(herb + &#39;\n&#39;)

f_out_asx.close()
f_out_obx.close()
```

```
$ cat allherbs.asx
herb1
herb3
herb4
```

```
$ cat allherbs.obx
herb2
herb5
```

---

## Example from Back in the Day

If we do both reading and writing in one program

```python
f_inp = open(&#34;allherbs.knx&#34;, &#39;r&#39;)
f_out_asx = open(&#34;allherbs.asx&#34;, &#39;w&#39;)
f_out_obx = open(&#34;allherbs.obx&#34;, &#39;w&#39;)

for line in f_inp:

    if &#34;aster:&#34; in line:
        herb = line.split()[1]
        f_out_asx.write(herb + &#39;\n&#39;)

    elif &#34;obeli:&#34; in line:
        herb = line.split()[1]
        f_out_obx.write(herb + &#39;\n&#39;)

f_inp.close()
f_out_asx.close()
f_out_obx.close()
```
---

## Choice of input file

Imagine Kaningentix didn&#39;t have only the file `allherbs.knx`, but also
`alldiseases.knx` and `allforces.knx`. Miraculix likes to have a program in
which he can decide upon the file to be decomposed.

```python
input_file_name = input(&#34;Please specify the input file name: &#34;)
```

Miraculix is then asked to specify the input file name. He typed `allherbs`.
The string &#34;allherbs&#34; is saved in the variable `input_file_name`.

https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input

---

## Choice of input file

Now Miraculix can interact with the program

```python
input_file_name = input(&#34;Please specify the input file name: &#34;)

f_inp = open(input_file_name + &#34;.knx&#34;, &#39;r&#39;)
f_out_asx = open(input_file_name + &#34;.asx&#34;, &#39;w&#39;)
f_out_obx = open(input_file_name + &#34;.obx&#34;, &#39;w&#39;)

for line in f_inp:

    if &#34;aster:&#34; in line:
        herb = line.split()[1]
        f_out_asx.write(herb + &#39;\n&#39;)

    elif &#34;obeli:&#34; in line:
        herb = line.split()[1]
        f_out_obx.write(herb + &#39;\n&#39;)

f_inp.close()
f_out_asx.close()
f_out_obx.close()
```
---

## Choice of input file

Imagine now that Miraculix gives a name of a file which does not exist. The
program breaks. Therefore, a test can be built in.

```python
input_file_name = input(&#34;Please specify the input file name: &#34;)

try:
    f_inp = open(input_file_name + &#34;.knx&#34;, &#39;r&#39;)

except IOError:
    print(&#34;File cannot be opened: &#34; + input_file_name + &#34;.knx&#34;)
    exit()
```

---

except IOError:
    print(&#34;File cannot be opened: &#34; + input_file_name + &#34;.knx&#34;)
    exit()
```

When a file is given in which does not exist, a simple message is given out and
the program terminates.

&lt;pre&gt;
Please specify the input file name: something
File cannot be opened: something.knx
&lt;/pre&gt;

## File name and extension

In the previous example we have dealt with three files, `allherbs.knx`,
`allherbs.asx`, and `allherbs.obx`.

The common part in the names of the files is the part in front of the `.`
delimiter.  The part after `.` is the file extension.

We can use some simple code to detect the file name and the file extension.

```python
input_file_name = input(&#34;Please specify the input file name: &#34;)

if &#34;.&#34; in input_file_name:
    parts = input_file_name.split(&#39;.&#39;)
    input_file_name = &#39;.&#39;.join(parts[:-1])
```

    parts = input_file_name.split(&#39;.&#39;)
    input_file_name = &#39;.&#39;.join(parts[:-1])
```

Using libraries, this can be done nicer:

```python
import os
input_file_name = input(&#34;Please specify the input file name: &#34;)
input_file_name, input_file_extension = os.path.splitext(input_file_name)
```

---

## Example from Back in the Day

```
$ cat allherbs.knx
Creator of file: Kaningentix
First test
Herbs Celts
aster: herb1
obeli: herb2
aster: herb3
aster: herb4
obeli: herb5
```

---

## Example today

It would be nicer to have the full names in the file.

```
$ cat allherbs_2.knx
Creator of file: Kaningentix
First test
Herbs Celts
asterix: petroleum
obelix: kerosine
asterix: cyanine
asterix: diesel
obelix: lpgas
```

---

## Example today

$ cat allherbs_2.knx
Creator of file: Kaningentix
First test
Herbs Celts
asterix: petroleum
obelix: kerosine
asterix: cyanine
asterix: diesel
obelix: lpgas
```

... and Miraculix will get ...

```
$ cat allherbs_2.asx
petraoleum
cyanine
diesel
```

```
$ cat allherbs_2.obx
kerosine
lpgas
```

---

## Some other type of printing

We know that the following code works

```python
file_name = &#34;obelix_dog&#34;
my_file_obj = open(file_name, &#39;w&#39;)
my_file_obj.write(&#34;Idefix&#34;)
my_file_obj.close()
```

---

## Some other type of printing

```python
file_name = &#34;obelix_dog&#34;
my_file_obj = open(file_name, &#39;w&#39;)
my_file_obj.write(&#34;Idefix&#34;)
my_file_obj.close()
```

It is also possible to say

```python
file_name = &#34;obelix_dog&#34;
my_file_obj = open(file_name, &#39;w&#39;)
print(&#34;Idefix&#34;, file=my_file_obj)
my_file_obj.close()
```

---

## Some other type of printing

It should be known that we should provide a string to `write`

```python
file_name = &#34;obelix_wprocs&#34;
file_obj = open(file_name, &#39;w&#39;)

number = 5
file_obj.write(str(number))

file_obj.close()
```

String formatting is also useful

```python
file_obj.write(&#34;{:d}\n&#34;.format(number))
```

Finally, the `open` function can have three options: read (&#39;r&#39;), write (&#39;w&#39;) -
and append (&#39;a&#39;). In the &#34;append&#34; mode, the extra output is written at the end
of the file.

## How to read strings and numbers?

In a file, Asterix keeps tracks of his weapons:

```
$ cat weapons.asx
knife: 4
spear: 2
arrow: 3
fist: 2
```

---

## How to read strings and numbers?

In a file, Asterix keeps tracks of his weapons:

```
$ cat weapons.asx
knife: 4
spear: 2
arrow: 3
fist: 2
```

The total sum of his weapons is given by `readlines()` followed by a `split()`
of each line.

```python
f_inp = open(&#34;weapons.asx&#34;, &#39;r&#39;)
lines = f_inp.readlines()
f_inp.close()

number = 0
for line in lines:
    number += int(line.split()[1])

print(number)
```

&lt;/pre&gt;

`split` separates parts of a line by a space, and save them in a list. Remark
that `line.split()` gives access to a list of strings.

## The sys module and some easy way of input

`sys.argv` contains the vector of arguments passed to a program via the command
line.

+ `sys.argv`[0] is the filename of the program.
+ `sys.argv`[1] is the first argument given.
+ `sys.argv`[2] the second etc.

Imagine that a program `program_test.py` contains two lines of code:

```python
import sys
print(sys.argv)
```

The output of `python program_test.py a b` is then

```
[&#39;program_test.py&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;]
```

`sys.argv`[0] contains then the name `program_test.py`, `sys.argv`[1] and
`sys.argv`[2] contain `a` and `b`, respectively.

## The sys-module and some safe way of input

Miraculix made a program `healthy_herb.py` which says whether or not a herb is
safe to be eaten or not.

As input parameters, the program needs to know the color of the herb as well as
its sites in the forest:

`python healthy_herb.py green river`

coded a small test:       

```python

   print (&#34;Usage: python healthy_herb.py color place&#34;)
   exit()

Of course, in the code, the arguments still have to be defined:

```
color = sys.argv[1]
place = sys.argv[2]
```
